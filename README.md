# hello-world
First repository

I haven't programmed seriously for 20-years.  I still write the occasional script in whatever language is the path of least resistance at the time.  Lately, I have been using PowerShell.  After visiting Pivotal Labs in SF, I realized I have completely missed out the whole open source movement.  My son leaves for college in the fall.  He's wants to triple major in Math, Software Engineering, and Computer Science.  He looks for advice since I'm his father and I have a degree in computer science from the mid-eighties.
